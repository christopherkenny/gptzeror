#' has been marked by widespread partisan gerrymandering, which has led to concerns
#' about its impact on electoral outcomes and democratic representation. This paper
#' examines the effects of partisan gerrymandering on electoral competition in the
#' 2020 congressional elections. Using data from previous election cycles and
#' simulations of the 2020 elections, we find that while partisan gerrymandering
#' mostly cancels out at the national level, it reduces competition in individual
#' districts, making them less competitive and reducing voter choice. We also find
#' that the impact of gerrymandering on electoral outcomes varies significantly
#' by state and political party, suggesting that redistricting can have significant
#' implications for democratic representation and political power in the United
#' States. The findings of this study have important implications for policymakers,
#' as well as advocates of fair and democratic elections.'
