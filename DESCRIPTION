Description: An R interface to the 'GPTZero' API (<https://gptzero.me/docs>). Allows 
    users to classify text probabilistically into human and computer written. Formats
    the data into data frames where each sentence is an observation. Paragraph-level
    and document-level predictions are organized to align with the sentences.
